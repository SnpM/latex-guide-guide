\subsection{What is \LaTeX?}
LaTeX (pronounced \enquote{Lah-Tech}) is a document preparation system for technical and scientiﬁc documents. LaTeX is not a word processor; instead, it encourages authors to focus on content rather than the appearance of their documents\footnote{\url{https://www.latex-project.org/about/}}.

LaTeX is great for producing high-quality technical documents in academic and professional contexts.

Overleaf can be used for a \texttt{refman}-based project, allowing authors to create formatted instructional guides with the power of \LaTeX.

\subsection{Using this Guide}
This document serves as a detailed guide for using \LaTeX, Overleaf, and \texttt{refman} to author an instructional guide. The guide sections are designed to be followed progressively to address the following topics: project setup, basic content-writing, extended design, and resources for learning more. New \LaTeX\ users will acquire a solid foundation of workflow and syntax to begin creating practical \LaTeX\ documents.
