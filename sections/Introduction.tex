\subsection{What is \LaTeX?}
LaTeX (pronounced \enquote{Lah-Tech}) is a document preparation system for technical and scientiﬁc documents. LaTeX is not a word processor; instead, it encourages authors to focus on content rather than the appearance of their documents\footnote{\url{https://www.latex-project.org/about/}}.

\LaTeX is an extension of \TeX, TODO: More stuff about LaTeX. Maybe companies using it and practical cases.

LaTeX is suitable for producing high-quality technical documents in academic and professional contexts.

\subsection{Authoring with \LaTeX}
Authoring projects with \LaTeX\ is streamlined with the many tools and templates available online.

\texttt{refman} is a collection of document classes used for writing technical reference manuals\footnote{\url{https://ctan.org/pkg/refman?lang=en}}; it includes formatted structure for document title page, table of contents, sections, and more. As a template, \texttt{refman} provides a polished starting point for technical reference manuals and guides.

By using Overleaf and \texttt{refman}, authors can quickly create formatted instructional guides with the power of \LaTeX.

\subsection{Using this Guide}
This document serves as a detailed guide for using \LaTeX, Overleaf, and \texttt{refman} to author an instructional guide. The guide sections are designed to be followed progressively to address the following topics: project setup, basic content-writing, extended design, and resources for learning more. New \LaTeX\ users will acquire a solid foundation of workflow and syntax to begin creating practical \LaTeX\ documents.
