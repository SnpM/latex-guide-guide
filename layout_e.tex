\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
         \LaTeX\ is a high-quality typesetting standard for academic and professional documents. The system may seem complicated because of its coding syntax, but powerful \LaTeX\ editors such as Overleaf streamline the learning the process. A wealth of high-quality \LaTeX\ templates exist online, enabling authors to focus on content rather than appearance. This guide teaches new \LaTeX\ users how to author an instructional \LaTeX\ document in Overleaf based on the \texttt{refman} template.
\end{abstract}

The \LaTeX\ Guide Guide is part of my final project for the Technical Communication course at Thomas Edison State University, mentored by Dr. Douglas Hoehn.
